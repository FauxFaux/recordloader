    <h3>ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD Flag</h3>
    Not everyone wants to include their password in the properties file. A "little" bit of security was added by adding the ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD Flag.
    When this flag is enabled the recordloader process will look for the "ciphertext" and "keyfile" files that contain the encrypted password to be used.
    To create the two encrypted password files, execute:
    <p>
      java -cp recordloader.jar com.marklogic.ps.PasswordEncrypter PASSWORD<br>
      Change PASSWORD to be the password that becomes encrypted
    </p>
    Now the properties file does not contain a password, and the encrypted password files can be kept seperate, securely and non-human readable.
